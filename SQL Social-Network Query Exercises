Students at your hometown high school have decided to organize their social network using databases. So far, they have collected information about sixteen students in four grades, 9-12. Here's the schema: 

Highschooler ( ID, name, grade ) 
English: There is a high school student with unique ID and a given first name in a certain grade. 

Friend ( ID1, ID2 ) 
English: The student with ID1 is friends with the student with ID2. Friendship is mutual, so if (123, 456) is in the Friend table, so is (456, 123). 

Likes ( ID1, ID2 ) 
English: The student with ID1 likes the student with ID2. Liking someone is not necessarily mutual, so if (123, 456) is in the Likes table, there is no guarantee that (456, 123) is also present.

Q1: Find the names of all students who are friends with someone named Gabriel. 


SELECT H1.name FROM Highschooler H1
inner join Friend F
on H1.ID=F.ID1
INNER JOIN Highschooler H2
ON H2.ID=F.ID2
WHERE H2.name='Gabriel'

Q2: For every student who likes someone 2 or more grades younger than themselves, return that student's name and grade, and the name and grade of the student they like. 

SELECT H1.name, H1.grade, H2.name, H2.grade FROM Highschooler H1
INNER JOIN Likes
ON H1.ID=ID1
INNER JOIN Highschooler H2
ON H2.ID=ID2
WHERE H1.grade>=H2.grade+2

Q3: For every pair of students who both like each other, return the name and grade of both students. Include each pair only once, with the two names in alphabetical order. 

SELECT H1.name, H1.grade, H2.name, H2.grade FROM Highschooler H1, Highschooler H2, Likes L1, Likes L2
WHERE (H1.ID=L1.ID1 AND H2.ID=L1.ID2) AND (L1.ID1=L2.ID2 AND L1.ID2=L2.ID1) 
AND H1.name<H2.name
ORDER BY H1.name, H2.name

Q4: Find all students who do not appear in the Likes table (as a student who likes or is liked) and return their names and grades. Sort by grade, then by name within each grade. 

SELECT name, grade FROM Highschooler
WHERE ID NOT IN (SELECT ID1 as ID FROM Likes UNION  SELECT ID2 AS ID FROM Likes)
ORDER BY grade, name

Q5: For every situation where student A likes student B, but we have no information about whom B likes (that is, B does not appear as an ID1 in the Likes table), return A and B's names and grades. 

SELECT A.name,A.grade, B.name, B.grade
FROM Highschooler A, Highschooler B
INNER JOIN LikeS l
ON A.ID=l.ID1 AND B.ID=l.ID2
WHERE ID2 NOT IN (SELECT ID1 AS ID2 FROM Likes)

Q6: Find names and grades of students who only have friends in the same grade. Return the result sorted by grade, then by name within each grade. 


SELECT name, grade
FROM Highschooler H1
WHERE ID NOT IN (
  SELECT ID1
  FROM Friend, Highschooler H2
  WHERE H1.ID = Friend.ID1 AND H2.ID = Friend.ID2 AND H1.grade <> H2.grade
)
ORDER BY grade, name;

Q7: For each student A who likes a student B where the two are not friends, find if they have a friend C in common (who can introduce them!). For all such trios, return the name and grade of A, B, and C. 

SELECT DISTINCT H1.name, H1.grade, H2.name, H2.grade, H3.name, H3.grade
FROM Highschooler H1, Highschooler H2, Highschooler H3, Likes L, Friend F1, Friend F2
WHERE (H1.ID = L.ID1 AND H2.ID = L.ID2) AND H2.ID NOT IN (
  SELECT ID2
  FROM Friend
  WHERE ID1 = H1.ID
) AND (H1.ID = F1.ID1 AND H3.ID = F1.ID2) AND (H2.ID = F2.ID1 AND H3.ID = F2.ID2);

Q8: Find the difference between the number of students in the school and the number of different first names. 

SELECT COUNT(*)- COUNT(DISTINCT name) FROM Highschooler

Q9: Find the name and grade of all students who are liked by more than one other student. 


SELECT name, grade
FROM Highschooler
INNER JOIN Likes ON Highschooler.ID = Likes.ID2
GROUP BY ID2
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
